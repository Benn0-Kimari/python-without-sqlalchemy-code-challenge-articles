# Phase 3 Code Challenge: Articles - without SQLAlchemy (Updated)

In this code challenge, you will be working with a Magazine domain.

We have three models: `Author`, `Article`, and `Magazine`.

For our purposes, an `Author` has many `Article`s, a `Magazine` has many
`Article`s, and `Article`s belong to both `Author` and `Magazine`.

`Author` - `Magazine` is a many to many relationship.

**Note**: You should draw your domain on paper or on a whiteboard _before you
start coding_. Remember to identify a single source of truth for your data.

## Instructions

To get started, run `pipenv install` while inside of this directory. Then run
`pipenv shell` to jump into the shell.

Build out all of the methods listed in the deliverables. The methods are listed
in a suggested order, but you can feel free to tackle the ones you think are
easiest. Be careful: some of the later methods rely on earlier ones.

**Remember!** This code challenge has tests to help you check your work. You can
run `pytest` to make sure your code is functional before submitting.

We've provided you with a tool that you can use to test your code. To use it,
run `python lib/debug.py` from the command line. This will start a `ipdb`
session with your classes defined. You can test out the methods that you write
here. You can add code to the `lib/debug.py` file to define variables and create
sample instances of your objects.

Writing error-free code is more important than completing all of the
deliverables listed - prioritize writing methods that work over writing more
methods that don't work. You should test your code in the console as you write.

Similarly, messy code that works is better than clean code that doesn't. First,
prioritize getting things working. Then, if there is time at the end, refactor
your code to adhere to best practices. When you encounter duplicated logic,
extract it into a shared helper method.

**Before you submit!** Save and run your code to verify that it works as you
expect. If you have any methods that are not working yet, feel free to leave
comments describing your progress..
